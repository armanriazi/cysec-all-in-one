### Quick Summary

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** 
  - Automates IP address assignment.
  - Works mainly with DORA process.

- **DORA Process:**
  - **Discover:** Client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER.
  - **Offer:** Server replies with a DHCPOFFER.
  - **Request:** Client requests the offered IP with DHCPREQUEST.
  - **Acknowledge:** Server acknowledges with DHCPACK.

- **BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol):**
  - Used for IP address assignment before DHCP.
  - Client sends BOOTREQUEST, server responds with BOOTREPLY.
