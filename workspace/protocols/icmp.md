#### Overview

- **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure during communication.

#### Common Uses

- **Error Reporting:** Notify hosts of issues in communications.
- **Diagnostics:** Used in tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.

### ICMP Error Handling Table

In the context of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), the numbers **3** and **0** refer to specific fields in the ICMP message that indicate the type of error and the code associated with that type.

### ICMP Error Message Structure

ICMP messages typically have the following header fields:

1. **Type (8 bits):** Indicates the type of the message (e.g., error message or echo request).
2. **Code (8 bits):** Provides additional context for the type (gives more specific information about the error).
3. **Checksum (16 bits):** Used for error-checking the header and data.
4. **Unused (32 bits):** Usually set to zero, used in some ICMP types for future use.
5. **Identifier (16 bits):** An identifier used for matching requests with replies (used in echo requests/replies).
6. **Sequence Number (16 bits):** A sequence number for the echo requests/replies to track multiple messages (used in echo requests/replies).

### Specific Example

For the ICMP message type you provided:

- **Type = 3:** This indicates **Destination Unreachable**, which is the type of the ICMP message.
- **Code = 0:** This indicates **Network Unreachable**.

The Type and Code together can help pinpoint exactly what the issue is within the broader category of destination unreachable messages.

### ICMP Error Handling Table (Detailed)

Here's the modified error handling table with specified headers, illustrating the connection between Type and Code:

| ICMP Type | ICMP Code | Meaning               | Recommended Action                  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3         | 0         | Network Unreachable    | Check routing configuration          |
| 3         | 1         | Host Unreachable       | Verify that the target host is operational |
| 3         | 2         | Protocol Unreachable   | Check routing configuration or application protocol support |
| 3         | 3         | Port Unreachable       | Ensure that the service is running on the target |
| 11        | 0         | Time to Live Exceeded  | Examine routing paths for loops     |
| 11        | 1         | Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded | Investigate maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings |

### Summary

- **3:** ICMP Type for "Destination Unreachable"
- **0:** ICMP Code for "Network Unreachable"

This table provides a clear understanding of the relationship between ICMP types and codes, helping network engineers and administrators troubleshoot issues effectively.

### ICMP Queries Table

| ICMP Type | Description                                    | Common Tools       | Example Command             |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| 8         | Echo Request                                   | `ping`              | `ping [destination]`       |
| 0         | Echo Reply                                     | `ping`              | (Automatically received upon ping) |
| 13        | Timestamp Request                              | Custom Tools        | `ping -t [destination]` (with timestamp option) |
| 14        | Timestamp Reply                                | Custom Tools        | (Automatically received upon timestamp request) |

### Key Characteristics

- **Transport Protocol:** ICMP operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
- **Connectionless:** It does not establish a connection before sending messages.
- **Error Handling:** Allows hosts to communicate error and status information back to the sender.

### Common Commands Related to ICMP

- **Ping (Echo Request):**
  - To check the reachability of a host:

  ```bash
  ping [hostname or IP]
  ```

- **Traceroute (Trace Route):**
  - To track the path packets take to reach a destination:

  ```bash
  traceroute [hostname or IP]  (Linux/Unix)
  ```

  ```bash
  tracert [hostname or IP]  (Windows)
  ```
