## RAID

Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into logical units for data redundancy and performance improvement. It differs from the concept of "single large expensive disk" (SLED). Data is distributed across drives in RAID levels, which balance reliability, availability, performance, and capacity. **not fault tolerence in RAID 0**[H1]
