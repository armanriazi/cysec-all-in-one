### Notes

- This table combines multiple compliance frameworks, highlighting major aspects of each.
- Specific requirements may vary based on organizational context, size, and nature of business, and entities may need to comply with multiple regulations.
- Consultation with compliance experts is recommended to ensure adherence to relevant laws and regulations for specific organizational needs.

**For CEH professionals and those engaged in programming or web development, PCI-DSS, NIST, and ISO/IEC 27001 are the most directly relevant compliance frameworks.** Understanding GDPR and CCPA also adds significant value when working with user data. The others play important roles in their specific contexts but may not be as directly applicable to general web development and ethical hacking.
