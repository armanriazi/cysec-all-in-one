Create a cybersecurity risk assessment template based on the best practices of 7 foundational of CIS Mobile Device Security Benchmark or OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) requirements for SL1.SL2, SL3, SL4 for a power utility. Designed to identify, assess, and manage the cybersecurity risks associated with CIS and MSTG. CIS and MSTG encompasses various systems used to ensure the security and integrity of mobile applications and devices, providing a comprehensive framework for identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing best practices in mobile application development and deployment.Keep this assessment segmented in a zone wise as per purdue model, like level 1to level 4, Include all technical, physical and administrative aspects of risk assessments of each foundation. include questions to be asked to assest owner, engineers, operators, field technicians and admin staff of the organisation . Write 5 questions for each perdue level as per your above response which has just one question and finally try to predict and give responses of each question. How to decide based on answers that what is the level of security ? Provide some method based on which we can decide the security level based on prior standards. Ok, now add this answer and concepts to your piror questions and tables.
Show this in tabular format.

Try to mix your results with this predefined template:

The enhanced **Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Template** combines elements from the previous content with a structured layout for assessing cybersecurity risks in a power utility based on CIS Mobile Device Security Benchmark or OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)  foundational requirements.
