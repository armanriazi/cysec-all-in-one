Create a cybersecurity risk assessment template based on the best practices of 7 foundational of  ISO 27001 requirements for SL1.SL2, SL3, SL4 for a power utility. Designed to identify, assess, and manage the cybersecurity risks associated with Web security. Websecurity encompasses various systems used to control web requests. Keep this assessment segmented in a zone wise as per purdue model, like level 1to level 4, Include all technical, physical and administrative aspects of risk assessments of each foundation. include questions to be asked to assest owner, engineers, operators, field technicians and admin staff of the organisation . Write 5 questions for each perdue level as per your above response which has just one question and finally try to predict and give responses of each question. How to decide based on answers that what is the level of security ? Provide some method based on which we can decide the security level based on ISO 27001. Ok, now add this answer and concepts to your piror questions and tables.
Show this in tabular format.

Try to mix your results with this predefined template:
