Using tools like Wireshark to analyze a specific TCP port (in this case, port 9001) and want a structured approach similar to what you might find on a website like auditmypc.com. Below is a guide on how to troubleshoot and analyze TCP port 9001 using Wireshark, along with ASCII art and a detailed breakdown.

### Troubleshooting and Malware Analysis for TCP Port 9001 Using Wireshark

#### Step 1: Set Up for Packet Capture

1. **Open Wireshark**: Launch the application on your computer.
2. **Select the Network Interface**: Choose the appropriate network interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet) you intend to monitor.

```plaintext
-----------------------------
|      Start Wireshark      |
| Select Your Network        |
-----------------------------
```

#### Step 2: Start Packet Capture

3. **Start the Capture**: Click on the “Capture” menu and select “Start”.
4. **Filter for TCP Port 9001**: Immediately apply a capture filter to monitor specific traffic. The filter syntax for capturing only packets using TCP port 9001 is:

```
tcp port 9001
```

```plaintext
-----------------------------
|       Capture Filter       |
|      tcp port 9001        |
-----------------------------
```

#### Step 3: Generate Traffic on TCP Port 9001

5. **Initiate Traffic**: From your local machines or any applications that utilize TCP port 9001, generate some traffic. This could involve using an application that establishes a connection to a server on that port.

```plaintext
---------------
| Generate TCP |
| Traffic on   |
| Port 9001    |
---------------
```

#### Step 4: Stop the Capture

6. **Stop Packet Capture**: Once you have generated sufficient traffic, return to Wireshark and click on "Stop".

```plaintext
---------------------
|    Stop Capture    |
---------------------
```

#### Step 5: Analyze the Captured Packets

7. **Display and Analyze the Capture**:
   - Use display filters to narrow down to TCP port 9001:

   ```
   tcp.port == 9001
   ```

```plaintext
-----------------------------
|      Apply Display Filter   |
|    tcp.port == 9001        |
-----------------------------
```

8. **Review Packet Details**: Click on individual packets to inspect the details in the middle pane. Look for TCP flags like SYN, ACK, or RST.

```plaintext
-------------------------------
|      Check TCP Flags        |
| SYN, ACK, RST, FIN          |
-------------------------------
```

#### Step 6: Use Expert Information

9. **Utilize Expert Information**: Go to the “Statistics” menu and select “Expert Information” to find any warnings or errors that may indicate issues with the packets.

```plaintext
---------------------------------
|     Expert Information        |
|  (Warnings/Errors Detected)  |
---------------------------------
```

#### Step 7: Reference and Documentation

10. **Reference TCP Port 9001**: According to auditmypc.com, verify what TCP port 9001 is used for. TCP port 9001 is commonly associated with a variety of services, including application monitoring and control. You can look up more about its specific use in your case.

#### Understanding the Context for Port 9001

- **Common Uses**: Port 9001 is often used for applications like JMX (Java Management Extensions) or other custom application management tasks.
- **Malware Indicators**: Watch for unknown connections or large amounts of data to unfamiliar hosts as potential malware indicators when reviewing captured traffic.
