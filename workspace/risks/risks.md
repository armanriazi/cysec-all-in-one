### ICS Security Matrix

An ICS Security Matrix is a structured framework designed to identify, assess, and manage the cybersecurity risks associated with Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ICS encompasses various systems used to control industrial processes, such as manufacturing, energy production, water treatment, and transportation systems. Given the critical nature of these systems, securing them against cyber threats is paramount.

### Mobile Security Matrix

By splitting the matrices into ICS and mobile security, we can see the distinct threats, controls, and considerations for security in each domain more clearly. Each matrix serves as a standalone reference for understanding security challenges and mechanisms associated with Industrial Control Systems and mobile platforms. This separation aids in developing specific strategies and controls tailored to the unique needs of each environment.
