ISMS stands for Information Security Management System, which is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information to remain secure. It includes people, processes, and IT systems by applying a risk management process.
This includes conducting risk assessments, defining security controls, and ensuring ongoing compliance through regular audits and reviews.

An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is critical for managing the security of sensitive information, ensuring systematic and consistent data protection.

ISO 27001 is focused on establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Key requirements include:

#### Key Components of ISMS

**Table: ISMS Components**

| Component                              | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Risk Assessment**                    | Identify and assess information security risks to determine appropriate controls.                    |
| **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**  | Document all applicable controls and outline how they are implemented.The org must create an SoA that details which controls from Annex A of ISO 27001 are applicable and how they are implemented.                             |
| **Continuous Improvement**             | Regular reviews, audits, and updates to enhance the ISMS based on new risks and technological developments. |
| **Documentation**                      | Maintain comprehensive documentation of security policies, procedures, and control measures for compliance and ease of audits. |

**Example of a Risk Assessment Process:**

1. **Identify Assets**: Catalog all information assets (data, systems, etc.).
2. **Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities**: Assess potential threats and existing vulnerabilities.
3. **Assess Risks**: Determine the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
4. **Implement Controls**: Apply security controls based on the risk assessment to mitigate the identified risks.
