### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the HTTP Request Structure**:
   - The request provided shows a `GET` request directed at the URL `/auth/cdcservlet`.
   - The `Host` header specifies the domain (`login.example.com`), and various other headers indicate the browser type, accepted content types, and session identifiers.

2. **Analyze the URL Path and Query Parameters**:
   - The path `/auth/cdcservlet` suggests that the server is likely running a Java-based application (e.g., Java Servlet).
   - The presence of parameters in the query string (e.g., `goto`, `RequestID`, `MajorVersion`, `MinorVersion`, `ProviderID`, `IssueInstant`) might hint at functionalities related to session management or [SSO] (Single Sign-On).

3. **Check Response Headers**:
   - Make a request to this URL and examine the HTTP response headers using developer tools available in browsers or tools like Postman, cURL, or browser extensions like HTTP Header Live.
   - Look for `Server` headers, which often indicate the server type (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Microsoft-IIS).
   - The `X-Powered-By` header can reveal information about the server technology (like PHP, ASP.NET, etc.).
   - See if there are any other custom headers that provide insights into the framework or language (like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.).

4. **Look for Technology-Specific Patterns**:
   - Evaluate any other endpoints or URLs. For example, `.jsp` or `.php` extensions in resources may indicate the use of specific technologies.
   - Check for patterns in the API structure or response payloads that might suggest the use of frameworks (e.g., Spring, Laravel).

5. **Use Online Tools**:
   - Utilize tools such as **BuiltWith**, **Wappalyzer**, or **Netcraft** to analyze the website. These tools can give you an overview of the technologies the site uses based on various fingerprints.
   - You can also use **Nmap** with the `http-server-header` script to enumerate servers and determine technologies.

8. **Monitor Cookies and Sessions**:
   - Examine cookies sent by the server (like `JSESSIONID`) and any session management practices suggested by their usage. Java applications typically use `JSESSIONID`, which implies a Java Servlet container.

9. **Explore Error Pages**:
   - Generate a few invalid requests intentionally. Often, error responses contain valuable information about the underlying framework in the messages.

10. **Check for Versioning Information**:

- If applicable, look for version strings in headers, comments, or error messages. Server software often unintentionally exposes these details through poorly configured error handling.

11. **Review Any Redirects**:

- If the response contains redirects (3xx status codes), examine the final destination with the same analysis efforts. Sometimes a different server provides more concrete information.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can systematically uncover server-side technologies behind an HTTP response. Always practice responsible disclosure and ethical considerations when analyzing web technologies, respecting privacy and security.

Discovering hidden functionalities in a web application can involve a combination of manual testing and automated tools. This process often requires security testing techniques that may include looking for [S2]**unlinked pages, hidden endpoints, and features not immediately visible to regular users**. Here's a real-world example, demonstrating how to approach this step-by-step.

   ```

### Analysis to Discover Server-Side Technology

To discover the server-side technology based on the corrected string, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Request Structure

- **Endpoint**: The endpoint `/auth/cdcservlet` suggests a servlet, likely indicating a Java-based backend (e.g., an application running on a Java servlet container like Apache Tomcat).

- **Query Parameters**:
  - `goto`, `RequestID`, `MajorVersion`, `MinorVersion`, `ProviderID`, `IssueInstant` suggests functionality related to authentication.
  - Investigate how these parameters behave when modified.

#### Step 2: Check for Response Headers

- **Use Developer Tools / HTTP Client**: Use tools like Burp Suite, Postman, or browser Developer Tools to examine the response headers when hitting the endpoint.
  - Look for:
    - `Server` header: Might indicate if it's running on Apache, Nginx, etc.
    - `X-Powered-By` header: Can indicate the underlying language/framework (like PHP, Express, etc.).

#### Step 3: Explore HTTP Responses

- **Make Requests**: Send a request to the endpoint and observe the HTTP responses.
- **Look for Error Messages**: Check if invalid requests return distinctive error messages that might divulge technology information (e.g., stack traces).

#### Step 4: Analyze HTML/JS Responses

- **Inspect Response Body**:
